            Use popular frameworks and tools right out-of-the-box. Focus on
            building features instead of configuring disparate components

          <h2>Build apps for any device</h2>
          <h3>
            Use the same code whether youâ€™re developing for web, iOS, Android,
            or desktop for a seamless update experience for your users.
          </h3>
          <h2>Trusted by over 500k developers</h2>
          <h3>
            Developed for over a decade and trusted by industry giants. Meteor
            is a mature open source framework that allows you to build and scale
            efficiently so you can serve millions of users.
